# **Pomodoro Grande**: A Chrome Extension Built to Fix What Others Miss!

I explored several Pomodoro extensions on the Chrome Web Store but found some inconveniences in all of them. I also went through user reviews to identify the features people felt were missing in these extensions.

This inspired me to create my own extension, [**Pomodoro Grande**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pomodoro-grande/hmkklgcpkihbecjbohepediganhefdof). It combines the classic Pomodoro Technique with powerful productivity tools to help you stay focused and efficient. Key features include:

### Timer Management

- Dynamic countdown display on the extension badge
- Customizable timer durations to match your productivity style
- Intuitive controls for starting, stopping, and managing breaks
- Quick break-skip functionality for flexibility

### Track Your Progress

- Analyze your performance in the past 7 days.

### Website Control

- Domain-level blocking with subdomain support
- URL whitelisting capabilities for permitted sites

### Task Organization

- Built-in to-do list functionality
- Simple task creation and management

### Smart Notifications

- Desktop notifications when timers complete
- Customizable notification sounds
- Adjustable notification volume controls
- Toggle notifications on/off as needed
