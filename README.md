# **Pomodoro Grande**: Advanced Pomodoro Timer!

I explored several Pomodoro extensions on the Chrome Web Store but found some inconveniences in all of them. I also went through user reviews to identify the features people felt were missing in these extensions. This inspired me to create my own extension, [**Pomodoro Grande**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pomodoro-grande/hmkklgcpkihbecjbohepediganhefdof). It combines the classic Pomodoro Technique with powerful productivity tools to help you stay focused and efficient.
